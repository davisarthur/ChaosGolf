# ChaosGolf

I made Chaolf in a 48 hour period for the 2021.2 Brackeys Game Jam. The theme of the game jam was "Let the chaos begin!"
I chose to develop a game based on the dynamical billiards since this is one of the simplest physical systems known to 
exhibit chaos. You can play Chaolf from my itch.io page: https://davisarthur.itch.io/chaolf

I hope to add additional levels and mechanics to the game in the near future!
